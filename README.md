 Movie Ticket Booking Web Application

Overview
Flatdango is a web application that allows users to browse movies at the Flatiron Movie Theater and purchase tickets for the showings. The application fetches movie data from a local JSON server and displays movie details such as title, runtime, showtime, available tickets, and description. Users can buy tickets if available, and the UI updates to reflect the number of tickets sold.
